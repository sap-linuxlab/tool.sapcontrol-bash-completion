# sapcontrol-bash-completion

A simple (and incomplete) bash completion for the `sapcontrol` command.

## Usage

After the command `sapcontrol` has been typed, press `-` followed by `<TAB>` to get all the suggestions.
Just `<TAB>` won't be enough, because only options exist as completion.

## Limitations

The generated completion has some limitations:

- Options with multiple variable arguments (like `-repeat`) have at best only a completion
  for the first argument (limitation of shell globing).

- Options where no sensible suggestions are possible (like `-function ParameterValue [<parameter>]`) have no completion.

- If the meaning of an argument is not clear, no completion exists.\

## To Do

- Fixing bugs and implement missing things (if people report them).
